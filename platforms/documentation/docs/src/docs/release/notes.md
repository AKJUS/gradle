We are excited to announce Gradle @version@ (released [@releaseDate@](https://gradle.org/releases/)).

Gradle now supports [Java 25](#java-25).

This release introduces new ways to [visualize task graphs](#task-graph) and [inspect project structures](#project-report).
[Build initialization](#build-init) for Kotlin projects now uses the kotlin-test dependency for more flexible test framework selection.
Command-line usability is improved with [console enhancements](#cli) and [clearer error messages](#error) for version conflicts.

Gradle @version@ introduces enhancements to the [Configuration Cache](#configuration-cache), a new read-only mode optimized for CI workflows, smarter reuse of cache entries when command-line properties change, and better compatibility with customized JVM security policies.

This release also includes several [build authoring improvements](#build-authoring), enhancements to the [Antlr](#antlr), [EAR](#ear) and [Publishing plugin](#plugin-publishing), and fixes for [composite builds using `--dry-run`](#dry-run).

## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating the [wrapper](userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) in your project:

```text
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@ && ./gradlew wrapper
```

See the [Gradle 9.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_9.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes, and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).

## New features and usability improvements

<a name="java-25"></a>
### Support for Java 25

With this release, Gradle supports [Java 25](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/25/).
This means you can now use Java 25 for the [daemon](userguide/gradle_daemon.html) in addition to [toolchains](userguide/toolchains.html).
Third-party tool compatibility with Java 25 may still be limited.
If you're using the [Tooling API](userguide/tooling_api.html), you’ll need to enable native access at startup due to its use of JNI.
See [JEP 472](https://openjdk.org/jeps/472) for details.

See [the compatibility documentation](userguide/compatibility.html#java_runtime) for more details.

<a name="task-graph"></a>
### Task graph visualization

Gradle offers a new way to visualize [task dependencies](userguide/build_lifecycle.html#task_graph) without executing the tasks.

Enable it with the `--task-graph` option:

```console
./gradlew root r2 --task-graph
```

This will print a textual tree-style visualization of the task graph for the specified tasks:

```text
Tasks graph for: root r2
+--- :root (org.gradle.api.DefaultTask)
|    \--- :middle (org.gradle.api.DefaultTask)
|         +--- :leaf1 (org.gradle.api.DefaultTask)
|         \--- :leaf2 (org.gradle.api.DefaultTask, disabled)
\--- :root2 (org.gradle.api.DefaultTask)
    +--- :leaf1 (*)
    |--- other build task :included:fromIncluded (org.gradle.api.DefaultTask)
    \--- :leaf4 (org.gradle.api.DefaultTask, finalizer)
         \--- :leaf3 (org.gradle.api.DefaultTask)


(*) - details omitted (listed previously)
```

This feature provides a quick overview of the task graph, helping users understand the dependencies between tasks without running them.

This feature is _incubating_ and may change in future versions.

<a name="project-report"></a>
### Enhanced Project Report

The [Project Report](userguide/project_report_plugin.html) has been updated to show the physical locations of projects in the file system, as well as their logical build paths:

```text
------------------------------------------------------------
Root project 'avoidEmptyProjects-do'
------------------------------------------------------------

Location: /usr/jsmith/projects/avoidEmptyProjects-do
Description: Example project to demonstrate Gradle's project hierarchy and locations

Project hierarchy:

Root project 'avoidEmptyProjects-do'
+--- Project ':app'
\--- Project ':my-web-module'

Project locations:

project ':app' - /app
project ':my-web-module' - /subs/web/my-web-module

To see a list of the tasks of a project, run gradle <project-path>:tasks
For example, try running gradle :app:tasks
```

This helps authors better understand the structure of hierarchical builds that use non-standard project directories.

<a name="build-init"></a>
### Build initialization uses the `kotlin-test` dependency for Kotlin projects

The [`init` task](userguide/build_init_plugin.html) generates Kotlin project builds using the `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test` dependency instead of the more specific `kotlin-test-junit5`.
This change allows the test framework variant (e.g., JUnit5, JUnit4, TestNG) to be inferred automatically based on the configured test runner.

For more details, see the [Kotlin Gradle Configuration documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/gradle-configure-project.html#set-dependencies-on-test-libraries) and the `kotlin-test` API reference.

<a name="cli"></a>
### CLI improvements

Most developers interact with Gradle through the [command-line interface](userguide/command_line_interface.html).
This release introduces several enhancements to improve usability and feedback in the terminal.

#### Rich console off-screen line indicator

When a build produces more console output than fits in the terminal, for example, due to parallel task execution, verbose logging, or frequent progress updates, the [ `rich` console](userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:rich_console) shows a helpful status line indicating how many lines are not currently visible:

```console
> (2 lines not showing)
```

![Console Shows Off Screen Lines](release-notes-assets/off-screen-lines.gif)

#### Plain console with colors

A new value for the [`--console` command line option](userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_customizing_log_format) called `colored` is available:

```console
./gradlew [...] --console=colored
```

The new `colored` console mode provides color highlighting without rich features like progress bars.
This makes it easier to spot errors and warnings in plain logs, especially in CI environments or
simple terminals where rich console output may not render well.

![Console Shows Rich Color Output](release-notes-assets/colored-console.gif)

<a name="error"></a>
### Error and warning reporting improvements

Gradle provides a rich set of [error and warning messages](userguide/logging.html) to help you understand and resolve problems in your build.

#### Improved error message for version constraint conflicts

Previously, when a [version constraint conflict](userguide/graph_resolution.html#sec:conflict-resolution) occurred, Gradle produced a verbose and hard-to-read error message, especially when transitive dependencies were involved.

It also was formatted in a way that was difficult to comprehend, especially when constraints involved in the conflict were added by transitive dependencies:

```text
> Could not resolve org:foo:3.2.
  Required by:
      root project 'test'
   > Cannot find a version of 'org:foo' that satisfies the version constraints:
        Dependency path: 'root project :' (conf) --> 'org:bar:2.0' (runtime) --> 'org:foo:3.1'
        Constraint path: 'root project :' (conf) --> 'org:platform:1.1' (platform) --> 'org:foo:{strictly 3.1.1; reject 3.1 & 3.2}'
        Constraint path: 'root project :' (conf) --> 'org:foo:3.2'
        Constraint path: 'root project :' (conf) --> 'org:baz:3.0' (runtime) --> 'org:foo:3.3'
        Constraint path: 'root project :' (conf) --> 'org:other:3.0' (runtime) --> 'org:foo:3.3'
```

This release introduces a cleaner, more focused error message that focuses attention on the conflicting versions required by the constraints involved in the conflict:

```text
> Could not resolve org:foo.
  Required by:
      root project 'mec0k'
   > Component is the target of multiple version constraints with conflicting requirements:
     3.1.1 - directly in 'org:platform:1.1' (platform)
     3.2
     3.3 - transitively via 'org:baz:3.0' (runtime) (1 other path to this version)
```

The improved error message makes dependency version conflicts much easier to diagnose by:

* Clearly states that the failure is due to a version constraint conflict for a component, not just an inability to find a suitable version in the configured repositories.
* Lists each conflicting version constraint involved in the resolution failure.
* Identifies where each constraint is declared (e.g., in the project, a direct dependency, a transitive dependency, or via dependency locking) without printing full dependency paths, which are often long and hard to read. Full paths remain available in the dependency insight report.
* Reports how many resolution paths lead to each constraint, but only prints the first one, which is typically enough to understand the issue.
* Omits non-strict dependency declarations, which don’t contribute to the conflict and only add noise.

Additionally, the error message concludes with a suggested [`dependencyInsight` command](userguide/viewing_debugging_dependencies.html#sec:identifying-reason-dependency-selection) for further investigation, giving you an actionable next step to explore the conflict in detail.

<a name="configuration-cache"></a>
### Configuration Cache improvements

The [Configuration Cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build time by caching the result of the configuration phase and reusing it for subsequent builds.
This feature can significantly improve build performance.

#### Configuration Cache read-only mode

This release introduces a new read-only mode of operation for the [Configuration Cache](userguide/configuration_cache_enabling.html#config_cache:usage:read_only).
In this mode, Gradle reuses existing cache entries (on a hit) but does not create new ones.

This may speed up CI builds that do not contribute their results to caches.
For example, a typical CI configuration might have main branch builds populate caches, while pull request builds only reuse them.
In such cases, enabling read-only mode can improve PR build times when the overhead of writing new cache entries outweighs the benefit of faster parallel task execution within the same project.

To enable the feature, specify the following flag in the command line when invoking Gradle:

```
./gradlew --configuration-cache -Dorg.gradle.configuration-cache.read-only=true
```

For more information, see [Making the Configuration Cache Read-Only](userguide/configuration_cache_enabling.html#config_cache:usage:read_only).

#### Improved hit rates for changes of `-P` command-line properties

Previously, changing any `-P` [project property](userguide/build_environment.html#sec:project_properties) on the command line invalidated the [Configuration Cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html), even if the property wasn't used during the configuration phase.

Consider the following Kotlin DSL example:

```kotlin
tasks.register("echo") {
    val value = providers.gradleProperty("value")
    doLast {
        println("value: ${value.orNull}")
    }
}
```

With previous versions of Gradle, multiple executions of the `echo` task with different `-P` arguments were unable to reuse the Configuration Cache:

```console
$ ./gradlew --configuration-cache echo -Pvalue=1

Calculating task graph as no cached configuration is available for tasks: echo

> Task :echo
value: 1

...
Configuration cache entry stored.
```

```console
$ ./gradlew --configuration-cache echo -Pvalue=2

Calculating task graph as configuration cache cannot be reused because the set of Gradle properties has changed: the value of 'value' was changed.

> Task :echo
value: 2

...
Configuration cache entry stored.
```

By detecting that the `value` property is never realized during the configuration phase, this release can reuse the configuration cache and make more scenarios run faster.

```console
$ ./gradlew --configuration-cache echo -Pvalue=1

Calculating task graph as no cached configuration is available for tasks: echo

> Task :echo
value: 1

...
Configuration cache entry stored.
```

```console
$ ./gradlew --configuration-cache echo -Pvalue=2

Reusing configuration cache.

> Task :echo
value: 2

...
Configuration cache entry reused.
```

Additionally, the [Configuration Cache report](userguide/configuration_cache_debugging.html#config_cache:troubleshooting) will include properties used during the configuration phase under the _Build configuration inputs_ tab.

#### Encryption honors the JVM’s default keystore type

Previously, Gradle always used the `PKCS12` keystore format for its encryption keystore (used by the [Configuration Cache](userguide/configuration_cache_requirements.html#config_cache:secrets)), ignoring the JVM’s default setting.
This caused problems for users running Gradle on JDKs with customized Java security policies, like those using FIPS-compliant mode with Bouncy Castle security provider.

Starting with this release, Gradle now honors the JVM’s default keystore type, as long as it supports storing symmetric keys.
If the default keystore is a known format that only supports asymmetric keys, Gradle will automatically fall back to `PKCS12`.
This makes Gradle more compatible with secure or customized JVM environments, while ensuring safe defaults for everyone else.

<a name="build-authoring"></a>
### Build authoring improvements

Gradle provides [rich APIs](userguide/getting_started_dev.html) for plugin authors and build engineers to develop custom build logic.

#### New `AttributeContainer.addAllLater()`

A new method, [`addAllLater`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/attributes/AttributeContainer.html#addAllLater(org.gradle.api.attributes.AttributeContainer)), has been added to the [`AttributeContainer`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/attributes/AttributeContainer.html) API.
It allows all attributes from one container to be lazily copied into another.

Here’s an example of how it works:

```kotlin
val color = Attribute.of("color", String::class.java)
val shape = Attribute.of("shape", String::class.java)

val foo = configurations.create("foo").attributes
foo.attribute(color, "green")

val bar = configurations.create("bar").attributes
bar.attribute(color, "red")
bar.attribute(shape, "square")
assert(bar.getAttribute(color) == "red")    // `color` is originally red

bar.addAllLater(foo)
assert(bar.getAttribute(color) == "green")  // `color` gets overwritten
assert(bar.getAttribute(shape) == "square") // `shape` does not

foo.attribute(color, "purple")
bar.getAttribute(color) == "purple"         // addAllLater is lazy

bar.attribute(color, "orange")
assert(bar.getAttribute(color) == "orange") // `color` gets overwritten again
assert(bar.getAttribute(shape) == "square") // `shape` remains the same
```

This API is particularly useful for cases where attributes need to be configured in a deferred or conditional way, such as in plugin development or complex dependency resolution logic.

#### Type-safe accessors for `compileOnly` plugin dependencies in precompiled Kotlin scripts

Previously, plugins added via a `compileOnly` dependency could not be applied or configured using [precompiled Kotlin script plugins](userguide/implementing_gradle_plugins_precompiled.html).
Precompiled Kotlin script plugins can use [type-safe accessors](userguide/kotlin_dsl.html#type-safe-accessors) for plugins added via `compileOnly` dependencies.

For example, the `buildSrc/build.gradle.kts` file below declares a `compileOnly` dependency on a third-party plugin:

```kotlin
plugins {
    `kotlin-dsl`
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly("com.android.tools.build:gradle:x.y.z")
}
```

A precompiled convention plugin in `buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/my-convention-plugin.gradle.kts` can now apply the plugin and use type-safe accessors to configure it:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.android.application")
}

android {
    // The accessor to the `android` extension registered by the Android plugin is now available
}
```

This improvement makes it easier to use and configure third-party plugins in custom build logic.

#### New `Gradle.getBuildPath()`

This release introduces a new method on the [`Gradle`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/invocation/Gradle.html) interface called [`getBuildPath()`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/invocation/Gradle.html#getBuildPath()).
It returns the path of the build relative to the root of the build tree:

* For the root build, it returns `:`.
* For included builds, it returns their path relative to the root build (e.g., `:my-included-build`).

This is equivalent to what [`BuildIdentifier.getBuildPath()`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/artifacts/component/BuildIdentifier.html#getBuildPath()) provides, but it’s now available directly from the `Gradle` instance, making it easier to determine which build a given project belongs to.

For example, you can get the build path of a build that a given project belongs to.

```kotlin
val project: Project = getProjectInstance()
val buildPath: String = project.gradle.buildPath
```

This complements existing APIs like [`Project.path`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/Project.html#getPath()).

#### Declare distribution repository in `MavenPublication.distributionManagement{}`

You can explicitly declare the distribution repository in the [POM](userguide/publishing_maven.html#sec:modifying_the_generated_pom) when publishing a [Maven publication](userguide/publishing_maven.html).

For example, to include GitHub Packages as the [distribution repository](javadoc/org/gradle/api/publish/maven/MavenPomDistributionManagement.html#repository(org.gradle.api.Action)) in the generated POM:

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("maven-publish")
}

publications.withType<MavenPublication>().configureEach {
  pom {
    distributionManagement {
      repository {
        id = "github"
        name = "GitHub OWNER Apache Maven Packages"
        url = "https://maven.pkg.github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<a name="antlr"></a>
### Antlr plugin improvements

The [Antlr plugin](userguide/antlr_plugin.html) integrates the [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) parser generator into builds, automatically generating Java sources from grammar definitions for compilation.

#### Simpler target package configuration for Antlr 4

The [`AntlrTask`](userguide/antlr_plugin.html) class supports a new [`packageName`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/plugins/antlr/AntlrTask.html#getPackageName()) property for setting the target package of generated code when using Antlr 4.
Previously, specifying the `-package` argument also required manually configuring the output directory to match the package structure.

The new `packageName` property simplifies this by automatically setting both the `-package` argument and the correct output directory based on the package.

Setting the `-package` argument directly is now deprecated and will become an error in Gradle 10.0.0.

```kotlin
tasks.named("generateGrammarSource").configure {
    // Set the target package for generated code
    packageName = "com.example.generated"
}
```

This option is only available when using Antlr 4 and will fail if used with earlier versions.

#### Antlr-generated sources are automatically tracked

In previous Gradle versions, if the [`Antlr`](userguide/antlr_plugin.html)-generated sources directory was changed, the associated Java source set was not updated automatically.
This required manual updates to ensure the source set included the new directory.

With this release, the generated sources directory is now automatically tracked.
When the output directory changes, the Java source set is updated accordingly.
Additionally, a task dependency is created between the source generation task and the source set, so tasks that consume the source set will correctly depend on Antlr code generation.

<a name="ear"></a>
### Ear plugin improvements

The [EAR plugin](userguide/ear_plugin.html) facilitates the assembly of Enterprise Archive (EAR) files for Java EE applications, packaging modules and deployment descriptors into a standard distributable format.

#### Support for Jakarta EE 11 deployment descriptors


It is possible to generate valid deployment descriptors for [Jakarta EE 11](https://jakarta.ee/release/11/) by specifying the corresponding version in the `deploymentDescriptor` instead of having to use a custom descriptor file.

```kotlin
tasks.ear {
    deploymentDescriptor {  // custom entries for application.xml:
        version = "11"
    }
}
```

<a name="dry-run"></a>
### Fixed `--dry-run` behavior in Composite Builds

Gradle now correctly respects [`--dry-run`](userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_execution_options) option in [Composite Builds](userguide/composite_builds.html), ensuring that tasks are not executed during the execution phase of included builds.

Note that tasks from some included builds may still be executed during configuration time, as part of their configuration logic.

This restores expected behavior and makes `--dry-run` safer for previewing task execution plans across composite builds.

<a name="plugin-publishing"></a>
### Publishing plugin improvements

The [Plugin Publishing plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.plugin-publish/2.0.0) has been updated to version 2.0.0.

This release adds compatibility with the Configuration Cache.
Note that the `signing` task only supports the Configuration Cache starting with Gradle 8.1.
For full compatibility, you’ll need Gradle 8.1.1 or later for signed publications.

All configuration properties now use the [Provider API](javadoc/org/gradle/api/provider/Provider.html).
Most builds won’t be affected, but you may need to adjust your scripts if you rely on advanced configurations.

Support for older Gradle versions has been removed.
The minimum supported version is now 7.4. Bundled dependencies have also been updated.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backward compatibility.
See the User Manual section on the "[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)" for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

* [`getDependencyFactory()`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/Project.html#getDependencyFactory()) in `Project`
