[[command_line_interface_basics]]
= Command-Line Interface Basics

The command-line interface is the primary **method of interacting with Gradle** outside the IDE.

TIP: Use of the <<gradle_wrapper.adoc#gradle_wrapper_reference, Gradle Wrapper>> is highly encouraged. Substitute `./gradlew` (in macOS / Linux) or `gradlew.bat` (in Windows) for `gradle` in the following examples.

== Running commands

Executing Gradle on the command line conforms to the following structure:

[source,text]
----
gradle [taskName...] [--option-name...]
----

Options are allowed _before_ and _after_ task names:

[source,text]
----
gradle [--option-name...] [taskName...]
----

If multiple tasks are specified, you should separate them with a space:

[source,text]
----
gradle [taskName1 taskName2...] [--option-name...]
----

Options that accept values can be specified with or without `=` between the option and argument.
The use of `=` is recommended:

[source,text]
----
gradle [...] --console=plain
----

Options that enable behavior have long-form options with inverses specified with `--no-`.
The following are opposites:

[source,text]
----
gradle [...] --build-cache
gradle [...] --no-build-cache
----

Many long-form options have short-option equivalents.
The following are equivalent:

[source,text]
----
gradle --help
gradle -h
----

[[command_line_executing_tasks]]
== Executing tasks

To execute a task called `taskName` on the root project, type:

[source,bash]
----
$ gradle :taskName
----

This runs the single `taskName` task and all of its <<tutorial_using_tasks.adoc#sec:task_dependencies,dependencies>>.

The leading colon (`:`) refers to the root project.
In multi-project builds, the colon is used to specify the exact path to a task.
A single colon (`:`) means “the root project,” while nested paths use colons to separate project names:

[source,bash]
----
$ gradle :subproject:taskName
----

This runs `taskName` in the `subproject` project.

If you omit the colon and just run:

[source,bash]
----
$ gradle taskName
----

Gradle will try to run `taskName` in the current directory’s project, which may or may not be the root project depending on where the command is run.

[[disambiguate_task_options_from_built_in_options]]
== Adding options for tasks

To pass an option to a task, prefix the option name with `--` after the task name:

[source,bash]
----
$ gradle taskName --exampleOption=exampleValue
----

You can consult the <<command_line_interface.adoc#command_line_interface_reference,Gradle Command Line Interface reference>> to learn more.
