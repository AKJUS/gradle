= Part 6: Add a Build Service

Learn the basics of authoring Gradle tasks by creating a simple one in your Build script.

****
**In this section, you will:**

- Understand Build Services
- Add a Build Service to the Plugin
****

[[part6_begin]]
== Step 0. Before you Begin

1. You initialized your plugin in <<part1_gradle_init_plugin.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>>.
2. You added an extension to your plugin in <<part2_add_extension.adoc#part2_begin,part 2>>.
3. You created a custom task in <<part3_create_custom_task.adoc#part3_begin, part3>>.
4. You added a build listener in <<part5_add_dataflow_action.adoc#part4_begin,part 4>>.
5. You wrote a unit test in <<part4_unit_test.adoc#part5_begin,part 5>>.

== Step 1. Understanding Build Services

Evolving the plugin from using a `BuildListener` to a `BuildService` is a smart move for cleaner design and better integration with Gradle’s lifecycle and caching system.

A Build Service in Gradle is a way to define shared, long-lived logic or state that can be used throughout the build lifecycle, in a clean and managed way.
It is essentially a Gradle-managed singleton that can be safely reused by tasks or plugins during the build.

It’s:

- Reusable across tasks and projects
- Configurable using input parameters
- Lifecycle-aware: `close()` is automatically called after the build
- Isolated: can be run in the configuration or execution phase
- Efficient: avoids duplicated setup (e.g., setting up an API client, caching state, tracking changes)

Congratulations, you have completed the tutorial!
