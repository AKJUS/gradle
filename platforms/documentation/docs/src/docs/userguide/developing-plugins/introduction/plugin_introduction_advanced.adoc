= Plugin Introduction

A Gradle plugin is an add-on that enhances your build by adding tasks, applying conventions, or enabling specific configurations.

*Plugins* lets you *extend and organize build logic* in a modular and reusable way.

You apply plugins using the plugins block:

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'org.springframework.boot' version '2.5.4'
}
----

When you apply a plugin, it typically does one or both of the following:

1. *Adds tasks to your build* - Plugins often expose tasks that perform a specific action.
+
For example, the Maven Publish Plugin adds a `publishToMavenLocal` task, which uploads artifacts to a Maven repository.
+
In many cases, these tasks are automatically wired into the task graph via `dependsOn` relationships, so you donâ€™t need to run them manually.

2. *Applies behavior and conventions* - Some plugins automatically configure parts of your build when applied.
+
For example, the Java Plugin creates the main and test source sets and applies sensible defaults for compiling and testing Java code.

Most plugins provide DSL blocks you can use to fine-tune their behavior in build scripts.
For instance, the Java plugin lets you configure how tests are run:

[source,groovy]
----
test {
    useJUnitPlatform {
        includeTags 'fast'
        excludeTags 'slow'
    }
}
----

== Plugin Types

Gradle supports *three types of plugins*, each applied at a different phase of the build lifecycle:

image::plugin-intro-advanced-1.png[]

=== 1. Init Plugins

* Applied globally to _all_ builds. Loaded from `~/.gradle/init.gradle[.kts]` or passed via the `--init-script` command-line option.
* Configure the Gradle runtime before the build even starts. Useful for enforcing corporate policies, setting up shared CI configuration, or applying global conventions.
* Implement the `Plugin<Gradle>` interface.

=== 2. Settings Plugins

* Applied in `settings.gradle[.kts]` files.
* Configure the build layout, such as which projects are included or how plugins are resolved.
* Implement the `Plugin<Settings>` interface.

=== 3. Project Plugins

* Applied in `build.gradle[.kts]` files.
* Configure tasks, dependencies, and project-specific behavior.
* Implement the `Plugin<Project>` interface.

== Plugin Scope

The *scope* of a *plugin* is determined by the *interface* it implements:

image::plugin-intro-advanced-2.png[]

Each *plugin type* is defined by the *interface* it implements and the stage of the build lifecycle where it applies:

[cols="25,25,25,25", options="header"]
|===
| Plugin Type | Interface | Scope | Applied In

| Init Plugin
| `Plugin<Gradle>`
| Global
| `init.gradle[.kts]` or `--init-script`

| Settings Plugin
| `Plugin<Settings>`
| Build Layout
| `settings.gradle[.kts]`

| Project Plugin
| `Plugin<Project>`
| Per-Project
| `build.gradle[.kts]`
|===

== Plugin Sources

Gradle *plugins* come for *three different places*:

=== 1. Core Plugins

* Bundled with Gradle itself (e.g., `java`, `application`).
* You don't author or publish them.

=== 2. Community Plugins

* Published by the community, typically via the link:https://plugins.gradle.org/[Gradle Plugin Portal].
* Distributed as binary JARs.

=== 3. Local Plugins

* Custom plugins you write yourself, for your own builds.

== Authoring Plugins

Gradle provides *two* main ways to create your own *custom plugins*:

image::plugin-intro-advanced-3.png[]

=== 1. Precompiled Script Plugins

* Written as `.gradle.kts` or `.gradle` files.
* Compiled automatically.
* Ideal for bundling simple conventions.

=== 2. Binary Plugins

* Typically implemented in Java, Kotlin, or Groovy.
* Packaged as JARs, reusable across multiple builds.
* Can be published to repositories for sharing.
