= Gradle Managed Types

Gradle Managed Types are the building blocks for writing modern, efficient, and cache-friendly build logic.

They replace eager properties (like `val file = File(...)`) with lazy, trackable inputs and outputs, enabling:

- Incremental builds
- Build cache support
- Configuration cache compatibility
- Accurate task input/output tracking

== Common Managed Types

[cols="~,~,~", options="header"]
|===
| Type                  | Purpose                                               | Use-Case

| `Property<T>`         | Lazy scalar value (e.g., a version number)            | A version string
| `ListProperty<T>`     | Lazy list of values (e.g., compiler args)             | A list of compiler args
| `MapProperty<K, V>`   | Lazy map of values (e.g., environment vars)           | A map of Maven Pom properties
| `RegularFileProperty` | Lazy reference to a single file (input or output)     | A single file input/output
| `DirectoryProperty`   | Lazy reference to a directory (input or output)       | A destination directory
| `Provider<T>`         | Lazily evaluated, read-only value (e.g., task output) | A dependency on task output
|===

== Eager vs Lazy

Gradle distinguishes between *eager* and *lazy* evaluation to control **when** values are computed and **how** they participate in up-to-date checks, caching, and task wiring.

Writing lazy, declarative build logic is key to unlocking Gradle’s performance features.

== Eager Evaluation

* Happens **immediately** during the configuration phase.
* Values are resolved *as soon as the line is executed*.
* Prevents Gradle from optimizing build logic.

[source,kotlin]
----
val version = project.version.toString()         // evaluated now
val file = File("build/output.txt")              // evaluated now
myTask.outputFile.set(file)
----

These eager values are resolved even if the task isn’t run, breaking configuration cache compatibility and reducing build performance.

== Lazy Evaluation

* Defers computation until it’s actually needed (usually during task execution).
* Enables Gradle to apply caching, parallel execution, and configuration avoidance.
* Fully supports configuration cache and incremental builds.

[source,kotlin]
----
val outputFile: RegularFileProperty = project.objects.fileProperty()
outputFile.set(layout.buildDirectory.file("output.txt"))                // evaluated later
----

Here, nothing is resolved immediately—Gradle delays evaluation until it’s actually required.

== Real-world example

This task will break the configuration cache due to eager access:

[source,kotlin]
----
// ❌ Not Configuration Cache compatible
tasks.register("printVersion") {
    doLast {
        val version = project.version.toString()
        println("Version is $version")
    }
}
----

The fix: use `Provider` or a `Property<String>`:

[source,kotlin]
----
// ✅ Configuration Cache compatible
tasks.register("printVersion") {
    val version: Property<String> = project.objects.property(String::class.java)
    version.set(project.version.toString())
    doLast {
        println("Version is ${version.get()}")
    }
}
----
