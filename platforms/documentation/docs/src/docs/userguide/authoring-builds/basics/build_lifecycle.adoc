[[build_lifecycle]]
= Build Lifecycle

As a build author, you write build logic by defining tasks and declaring how they depend on one another.
Gradle uses this information to construct a **task graph** that models the relationships between these tasks.

For example, if your project includes tasks such as `build`, `assemble`, and `createDocs`, and you declare that `assemble` depends on `build`, and `createDocs` depends on `assemble`, Gradle constructs a graph with this order: `build` → `assemble` → `createDocs`.

== Task Graphs

Gradle builds the task graph *before* executing any task(s).

Across all projects in the build, tasks form a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph[Directed Acyclic Graph^] (DAG).

This diagram shows two example task graphs, one abstract and the other concrete, with dependencies between tasks represented as arrows:

[[build_lifecycle_events]]
Your build scripts and plugins are responsible for declaring this task dependency graph, either explicitly via the <<tutorial_using_tasks.adoc#sec:task_dependencies,task dependency mechanism>> (e.g., `dependsOn`) or implicitly using <<incremental_build.adoc#sec:task_inputs_outputs,task annotation>> (e.g., by wiring task inputs and outputs).

[[sec:build_phases]]
== Build Phases

A Gradle build has three distinct phases.

image::author-gradle-1.png[]

Gradle runs these phases in order:

Phase 1. Initialization::
- Detects the `settings.gradle(.kts)` file.
- Creates a link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html[`Settings`] instance.
- Evaluates the settings file to determine which projects (and included builds) make up the build.
- Creates a link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Project.html[`Project`] instance for every project.
Phase 2. Configuration::
- Evaluates the build scripts, `build.gradle(.kts)`, of every project participating in the build.
- Creates a task graph for requested tasks.
Phase 3. Execution::
- Schedules and executes the selected tasks.
- Dependencies between tasks determine execution order.
- Execution of tasks can occur in parallel.

image::build-lifecycle-example.png[]

The following example shows which parts of settings and build files correspond to various build phases:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildlifecycle/basic/kotlin",files="settings.gradle.kts[];build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildlifecycle/basic/groovy",files="settings.gradle[];build.gradle[]"]
====

The following command executes the `test` and `testBoth` tasks specified above.
Because Gradle only configures requested tasks and their dependencies, the `configured` task never configures:

[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
----
> gradle test testBoth
include::{snippetsPath}/buildlifecycle/basic/tests/buildlifecycle.out[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
----
> gradle test testBoth
include::{snippetsPath}/buildlifecycle/basic/tests/buildlifecycle.out[]
----

[[sec:initialization]]
== Phase 1. Initialization

In the *initialization phase*, Gradle detects the set of projects (root and subprojects) and included builds participating in the build.

Gradle first evaluates the settings file, `settings.gradle(.kts)`, and instantiates a `Settings` object.
Then, Gradle instantiates `Project` instances for each project.

[[sec:configuration]]
== Phase 2. Configuration

In the *configuration phase*, Gradle adds tasks and other properties to the projects found by the initialization phase.

[[sec:project_evaluation]]
[[sec:execution]]
== Phase 3. Execution

In the *execution phase*, Gradle runs tasks.

Gradle uses the task execution graphs generated by the configuration phase to determine which tasks to execute.
