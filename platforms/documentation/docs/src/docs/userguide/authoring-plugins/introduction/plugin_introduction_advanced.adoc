= Plugin Introduction

Gradle's plugin system lets you extend and organize build logic in a modular and reusable way.
Plugins can add tasks, configure settings, and enforce conventions across different scopes of a build.

Gradle supports three types of plugins, each applied at a different phase of the build lifecycle:

== Init Plugins

* Applied globally to _all_ builds.
* Useful for enforcing corporate policies, setting up shared CI configuration, or applying global conventions.
* Loaded from `~/.gradle/init.gradle[.kts]` or passed via the `--init-script` command-line option.
* Implement the `Plugin<Gradle>` interface.

== Settings Plugins

* Applied in `settings.gradle[.kts]` files.
* Used to configure the build layout, such as which projects are included or how plugins are resolved.
* Implement the `Plugin<Settings>` interface.

== Project Plugins

* Applied in `build.gradle[.kts]` files.
* Configure tasks, dependencies, and project-specific behavior.
* Implement the `Plugin<Project>` interface.

== Plugin Scope

The scope of a plugin is determined by the interface it implements:

|===
| Plugin Type | Interface | Scope | Applied In

| Init Plugin
| `Plugin<Gradle>`
| Global
| `init.gradle[.kts]` or `--init-script`

| Settings Plugin
| `Plugin<Settings>`
| Build Layout
| `settings.gradle[.kts]`

| Project Plugin
| `Plugin<Project>`
| Per-Project
| `build.gradle[.kts]`
|===

== Types of Plugins

Gradle plugins come in several flavors, each suited to different use cases:

=== Core Plugins

* Bundled with Gradle itself (e.g., `java`, `application`).
* You don't author or publish them.

=== Community Plugins

* Published by the community, typically via the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/).
* Distributed as binary JARs.

=== Local Plugins

* Custom plugins you write yourself, for your own builds.
* Can be:

** Precompiled Script Plugins
*** Written in `.gradle.kts` or `.gradle` files.
*** Quick to write, great for local conventions.
*** Always behave as `Project` plugins.

** Binary Plugins
*** Implemented in Java, Kotlin, or Groovy.
*** Packaged as JARs, reusable across multiple builds.
*** Can be published to repositories for sharing.

== Authoring Plugins

Gradle provides three main ways to create your own plugins:

=== Precompiled Script Plugins

* Written as `.gradle.kts` or `.gradle` files, compiled automatically.
* Simple to write but limited to `Project` plugins.
* Ideal for bundling simple conventions and applying standard tasks.

=== Convention Plugins

* A type of precompiled script plugin, typically used to:
** Bundle together multiple plugins.
** Apply shared configuration across projects.

=== Binary Plugins

* Implemented in Java, Kotlin, or Groovy.
* Can implement any plugin type: `Init`, `Settings`, or `Project`.
* Ideal for reusable logic shared across teams or published publicly.
