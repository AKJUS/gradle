= How to Downgrade Dependencies in Gradle

This guide explains how to **downgrade transitive dependencies** in Gradle when your project requires an older version due to API compatibility, bugs, or other constraints.

== Why Downgrade a Dependency?

By default, Gradle **resolves dependency version conflicts** by selecting the latest version found in the dependency graph.
However, there are cases where an earlier version is required:

* A **bug** exists in the latest release.
* Your project **depends on an older API** that is incompatible with newer versions.
* Your code does **not require** the features that demand a higher version.

Before downgrading, consider **updating your source code** to support the latest version instead.

Additionally, you should make sure there aren't existing rule or conditions, including platforms or version catalogs, that are setting the dependency to an undesired version in your project.

If downgrading is necessary, use **strict dependencies** or **forced dependencies**.

== Enforcing a Strict Version of a Dependency

Gradle allows you to enforce a <<dependency_versions.adoc#sec:rich-version-constraints,**strict version**>> for a dependency, ensuring that the selected version cannot be upgraded by transitive dependencies.

=== Setting a Strict Version

Suppose a project depends on **HttpClient**, which pulls in **Commons Codec 1.10**, but your project requires **Commons Codec 1.9**.
You can enforce the required version by setting a **strict version constraint**:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
    implementation("org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:4.5.4")
    implementation("commons-codec:commons-codec") {
        version {
            strictly("1.9")
        }
    }
}
----

Important notes about strict versions:

- A **strict version behaves like a force**, meaning it overrides transitive dependencies.
- If another dependency **requires a higher version**, Gradle **will fail** with a resolution error.
- Use **version ranges** instead of absolute strict versions to allow flexibility.

=== Setting a Strict Version Range

Instead of locking to a single version, define a **strict range**:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    implementation("commons-codec:commons-codec") {
        version {
            strictly("[1.9,2.0[")  // Allows versions >=1.9 and <2.0
            prefer("1.9")  // Prefers 1.9 but allows newer versions in range
        }
    }
}
----

If another dependency requires **1.10**, Gradle can resolve it without failure, as long as it falls within the specified range.

== Forcing a Version at the Configuration Level

If a strict dependency is **too restrictive**, you can **force** a specific version for an entire configuration using `resolutionStrategy.force()`.

=== Forcing a Version for the Entire Build

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
configurations {
    compileClasspath {
        resolutionStrategy.force("commons-codec:commons-codec:1.9")
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation("org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:4.5.4")
}
----

This ensures that **Commons Codec 1.9 is always used**, even if transitive dependencies request a newer version.

== Summary

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Approach | Behavior

| *Strict version (`strictly()`)*
| The version is enforced but can trigger resolution failures if conflicts exist.

| *Forced version (`force()`)*
| The version is forcibly applied at the configuration level, overriding all other constraints.
|===

In summary:

- ✅ **Use strict versions** if you need to enforce an older version and want to control compatibility.
- ✅ **Use version ranges** with a preferred version to allow some flexibility.
- ✅ **Use `force()` at the configuration level** when you need to override transitive dependencies without strict constraints.

**Always test thoroughly** after downgrading a dependency to avoid runtime errors.
