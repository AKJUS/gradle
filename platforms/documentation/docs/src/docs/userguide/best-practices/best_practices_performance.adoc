[[use_utf8_encoding]]
== Use UTF-8 File Encoding

Set `UTF-8` as the default file encoding to ensure consistent behavior across platforms.

=== Explanation

Use `UTF-8` as the default file encoding to ensure consistent behavior across environments and avoid caching issues caused by platform-dependent default encodings.

This is especially important when working with build caching, since differences in file encoding between environments can cause unexpected cache misses.

To enforce `UTF-8` encoding, add the following to your `gradle.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
----

NOTE: Do not rely on the default encoding of the underlying JVM or operating system, as this may differ between environments and lead to inconsistent behavior.

[[use_configuration_cache]]
== Use the Configuration Cache

Use the Configuration Cache to significantly improves build performance by caching the result of the configuration phase and reusing it in subsequent builds.

=== Explanation

The Configuration Cache works by saving the result of the configuration phase.
On the next build, if nothing relevant has changed, Gradle skips configuration entirely and loads the cached task graph from disk, jumping straight to task execution.

This can dramatically reduce build time, especially in large builds, as long as your build scripts and plugins are compatible (i.e., no dynamic or undeclared inputs).

Itâ€™s important to understand how this differs from the Build Cache.
The Build Cache stores the outputs of task execution, while the Configuration Cache stores the configured task graph before execution begins.
These are independent mechanisms that solve different problems, but they are designed to work together for optimal performance.

=== Example

Configuration caching is disabled by default:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/useConfigurationCache-avoid/kotlin",files="gradle.properties[]"]
====

==== Do This Instead

To enable the Build Cache, add the following to your `gradle.properties` file:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/useConfigurationCache-do/kotlin",files="gradle.properties[]"]
====

When you build your project for the first time, Gradle populates the cache with the outputs of tasks like compilation.

Even if you run `./gradlew clean` to delete the build directory, Gradle can reuse cached outputs in subsequent builds.

----
> ./gradlew clean
:clean
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----

On subsequent builds, instead of executing the `:compileJava` task again, the outputs of the task will be loaded from the Build Cache:

----
> ./gradlew compileJava
include::{snippetsPath}/bestPractices/useBuildCache-do/tests/useConfigurationCache-do.secondRun.out[]
----
