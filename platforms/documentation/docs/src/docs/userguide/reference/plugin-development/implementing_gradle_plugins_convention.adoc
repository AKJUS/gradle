= Convention Plugins
:keywords: convention, plugin

A *convention plugin* is a type of *pre-compiled script plugin*.

A *convention plugin* is a plugin that normally configures existing core and community plugins with your own conventions (i.e. default values) such as setting the Java version by using `java.toolchain.languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(17)`.

Convention plugins are also used to enforce project standards and help streamline the build process.
They can apply and configure plugins, create new tasks and extensions, set dependencies, and much more.

Convention plugins are preferred over `allprojects {}` / `subprojects {}` blocks or ad-hoc script plugins because they:

- Provide centralized, reusable conventions that can be applied consistently across multiple projects.
- Are compiled and type-checked, giving you IDE completion and early feedback.
- Make the build more maintainable and explicit.
- Can be versioned, published, and reused like any other plugin.

== Creating a convention plugin

Convention plugins are typically placed in either:

* `buildSrc/` — simplest approach, automatically on the classpath of the build.
* an included build (commonly named `build-logic/`) — more scalable, especially for multi-project builds or organizations.

Any `.gradle.kts` (or `.gradle`) script file in `src/main/kotlin/` or `src/main/groovy/` of that plugin build becomes a precompiled script plugin, and its file name defines the plugin ID.
